# Weather-Forecast
https://mleesers.github.io/Weather-Forecast/


The goal was to create a website that uses a user inputted city to find weather for that city and save the searches

To do this I used two different API's to retrieve data and used one to complete the link for the other.I then set this data on the html to give the requested weather details. The city searched is then saved in local storage and based on the searches generate a button
